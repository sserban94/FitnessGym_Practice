This is a Fitness Gym Winforms C# project. 
It lets the user add the first name, last name, the type of membership and the price of membership. Everything is validates in here so that the user can't make the app crash. The info is shown in a list view where the user can add, edit, delete members and also export and import to/from sqlite files.
Via a context menu strip the members can be sorted by the price of their subscriptions.
